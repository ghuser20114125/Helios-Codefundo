Prediction and Prevention of Natural Disasters.

We believe that regions surrounding the area affected by the natural disaster must be the primary source of help for the people affected by a natural disaster and hence they must be equipped adequately to help the affected region. The goal of our team is to help the neighbouring regions brace for the impact of migration from an affected region and facilitate a smooth transition to normality for affected parties.
Our team is planning to build a system which, based on migration patterns and economic data from previous disasters, will predict:
1. Where the people from the area affected by the disaster will migrate
2. Using the aforementioned prediction we hope to also predict the amount of resources that need to be allocated by the region so that        there is no shortage of resources such as food, shelter and clothing.

We are going to use Machine Learning to predict the migration pattern and the amount of resources required to be allocated.
